Catalyst is an entirely componentized and permissionless system with no inherent trust elements.
It is up to integrators to mix and match components as needed.

Catalyst offers two ways to swap:

1. Off-chain relay, via the order server (recommended)
2. On-chain deposits.

Catalyst recommends that you use off-chain relay for a cheaper and more seamless experience.
Though, for a fully decentralised system the on-chain deposit may provide advantages for you.

:::note
The order server is designed as a convenience and **is not mandatory**.
If you want you can create create the order on-chain and implement your own logic if needed.

### Getting a quote

You can implement your own quoting logic but the order server allows you to query Catalyst solvers' inventory. This provides you with a better execution guarantee.

```typescript
const getQuote = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("order-server-uri/quotes/request", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      // Chain identifiers as chain IDs
      fromChain: "11155111", // Sepolia testnet
      toChain: "84532", // Base Sepolia testnet

      // Token addresses on respective chains
      fromAsset: "0xf08A50178dfcDe18524640EA6618a1f965821715", // Token on Sepolia
      toAsset: "0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238", // Token on Base Sepolia

      // Amount in the smallest unit of the token
      amount: "3000000", // Amount with appropriate decimals. For USDC it is 6.
    }),
  });

  /**
     * {
            "fromChainId": 11155111,
            "toChainId": 84532,
            "fromAsset": "0xf08a50178dfcde18524640ea6618a1f965821715",
            "toAsset": "0x1c7d4b196cb0c7b01d743fbc6116a902379c7238",
            "inputAmount": 3000000,
            "outputAmount": 2996000,
            "quote": 0.9986666666666667
        }
   */
  return await response.json();
};
```

## Order structure

A Catalyst order generally follows the structure of the `CatalystCompactOrder`:

```solidity
struct CatalystCompactOrder {
    /** @dev Pays for the inputs of the order. If the order fails, will be recipient of the refund. */
    address user;
    /** @dev Allocator nonce for the order. Should be unique otherwise it won't be signed by the allocator. */
    uint256 nonce;
    /** @dev The chainId (canonical) of the input chain. */
    uint256 originChainId;
    /** @dev The expiry of the lock. Enough time for the fill and validation needs to be provided. */
    uint32 fillDeadline;
    /** @dev Address of the validation layer on the origin chain. */
    address localOracle;
    uint256[2][] inputs;
    OutputDescription[] outputs;
}
```

The `CatalystCompactOrder` needs to be appropriately signed. For `TheCompact` settlement interface, use the following transformation:

```solidity
struct BatchCompact {
    address arbiter; // Associated settlement contract
    address sponsor; // CatalystCompactOrder.user
    uint256 nonce; // CatalystCompactOrder.nonce
    uint256 expires; // CatalystCompactOrder.fillDeadline
    uint256[2][] idsAndAmounts; // CatalystCompactOrder.inputs
    CatalystWitness witness;
}

struct CatalystWitness {
    uint32 fillDeadline; // CatalystCompactOrder.fillDeadline
    address localOracle; // CatalystCompactOrder.localOracle
    OutputDescription[] outputs; // CatalystCompactOrder.outputs
}
```

The [sponsor](/glossary#sponsor) (user) shall then sign it as an [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signed structure.

### Inputs

For `TheCompact`, the inputs need to be provided as an array of `[uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount]`. The `tokenId` refers to the `TheCompact` encoded tokenId, the first 12 bytes is a [lock tag](https://github.com/Uniswap/the-compact/blob/v1/src/lib/IdLib.sol#L220-L224) and the last 20 bytes is the token address.

### Output

```solidity
struct OutputDescription {
    bytes32 remoteOracle;
    bytes32 remoteFiller;
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 token;
    uint256 amount;
    bytes32 recipient;
    bytes remoteCall;
    bytes fulfillmentContext;
}
```

Note that `OutputDescription.remoteOracle` and `CatalystCompactOrder.localOracle` need to match. Together, they define the validation layer used. Each order should only use one validation layer, which can be an aggregation of AMBs.

`remoteFiller` specifies the output type. For limit orders, use the `CoinFiller` and set `fulfillmentContext` as empty (`0x`). For Dutch auctions, use the `CoinFiller` and set `fulfillmentContext` [appropriately](/solver/auctions#dutch-auction).

Specify the token as the `bytes32` identifier. For EVM, the address is left-padded, e.g., `0x000...00abcdef`.

#### RemoteCall

You can schedule additional calls to happen after token delivery. Note that if you have configured multiple outputs, the order of execution is not guaranteed (it may happen over multiple blocks). If `remoteCall` is provided, the `recipient` is called using the Catalyst interfaces. For arbitrary calls, the [Catalyst Multicaller](https://github.com/catalystsystem/catalyst-intent/blob/main/src/integrations/CatsMulticallHandler.sol) can be used.

## Off-chain relay via resource locks

Off-chain relaying of swaps assumes that you have an existing [resource lock](/glossary#resource-lock) somewhere. This guide we assumes you use [TheCompact](/architecture/input#compactsettler). When using pure resource lock flow, ensure funds are already deposited into the lock. For alternative integrations, refer to the [on-chain flow](#on-chain-relay).

```typescript
// Submit an order to the order server
const submitOrder = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("order-server-uri/orders/submit", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      // Type of order to submit
      orderType: "CatalystCompactOrder",

      // Quote information for the swap

## On-chain relay

For non-wallet integrators, **on-chain deposits** is the easiest integration. It uses more gas but abstracts the resource lock complexity away: There are 2 ways to do on-chain relaying of swaps:

1. Using the [`CompactSettlerWithDeposit`](localhost:4321/architecture/input/#with-deposit). This provides you with an easy and quick integration at a slight increased gas overhead.
    ```solidity
    function depositFor(CatalystCompactOrder calldata order, ResetPeriod resetPeriod) external;
    ```
2. Using a custom `depositAndRegisterFor` implementation similar to the [LI.FI facet](https://github.com/reednaa/lifi-contracts/blob/catalyst/src/Facets/CatalystFacet.sol). This requires a slightly more complicated
