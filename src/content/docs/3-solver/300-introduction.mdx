As a solver in the cross-chain ecosystem, you're likely focused on:

- Accessing reliable order flow
- Minimizing user escrow unlock times to reduce inventory requirements
- Having flexibility in your liquidity sources

### How LI.FI Intent Helps

- **Direct access to [LI.FI](http://li.fi/)'s significant order flow**
- **Freedom to use any liquidity source** for solving (e.g., DEXs, CEXs, or your own inventory)
- **Fast user escrow unlock times** (typically less than 2 minutes)
- **Lower capital requirements** due to quick repayment cycles

## Solving Intents

LI.FI intent is an entirely permissionless system. Since the system is componentized and components have no inherent trust elements with other components, they can be mixed and matched as desired by users. As a result, it is important that you validate orders in their entirety once received. The general flow is:

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. The sponsor signs the LI.FI intent-compatible lock and sends it to the LI.FI order server.

2. The LI.FI order server preliminarily validates the order and obtains the allocator co-signature for the order. It is then broadcasted to solvers.

3. A solver submits the order's output to the output settlement contract, starting the oracle system.

    :::note[[Output Settlement](/architecture/output)]
    is denoted as the `output.settler`.
    :::

4. The proof is delivered to the input chain through the validation layer.

    :::note[[Oracle system](/architecture/oracle)]
    is denoted as the `localOracle` and `output.oracle` in the order struct.
    :::

5. The solver submits the order to the input settlement contract, verifying the delivery and unlocking the associated input tokens.

</Steps>


### Order Types

LI.FI uses 3 order structures, listed from least verbose to most verbose:
1. `BatchClaim`: Signed intent that allows for claiming input assets.
2. `StandardOrder`: Definition of the on-chain containing enough information to conveny the intent.
3. Order Server response: Hydrated order with additional information that may be helpful to solvers.

Unless you are verifying order signatures, you won't touch `BatchClaim`, all on-chain interactions work with `StandardOrder` to standardize interfaces. However `StandardOrder` does not contain enough information to fill intents. As a result, it is hydrated off-chain with `InputSolver`, `signatures`, and more.

### Collecting Orders

LI.FI intent offers two ways of receiving orders:

1. **Recommended**: Connect to the order server via WebSocket.
2. **Alternative**: Monitor on-chain deposits through the deposit interface.

The order server is the recommended integration surface for most solvers. However, if you are interested in the lowest latency, decentralized, and permissionless order discovery, you can read some orders on-chain. Not all orders will be discoverable on-chain. From either source you will receive a `StandardOrder` and other fill details to be submitted across all VMs:

```solidity
struct StandardOrder {
    address user;
    uint256 nonce;
    uint256 originChainId;
    uint32 expires;
    uint32 fillDeadline;
    address localOracle;
    uint256[2][] inputs;
    MandateOutput[] outputs;
}
```

Where `uint256[2][] inputs === [uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount][]` and `MandateOutput`:

```solidity
struct MandateOutput {
    bytes32 oracle;
    bytes32 settler;
    uint256 chainId;
    bytes32 token;
    uint256 amount;
    bytes32 recipient;
    bytes call;
    bytes context;
}
```

## Filling Intents

To fill intents, the execution of all `MandateOutput`s has to be done; Each `MandateOutput` is a self contained execution description.
- `output.settler` defines the execution with its associated context and should be called on its interface. Currently, only one OutputSettler is implemented: [`OutputSettlerCoin.sol`](https://github.com/openintentsframework/oif-contracts/blob/main/src/output/coin/OutputSettlerCoin.sol) which have 2 interfaces for filling:

```solidity
/// @notice For implementing own batching functionality
function fill(
    uint32 fillDeadline,
    bytes32 orderId,
    MandateOutput calldata output,
    bytes32 proposedSolver
) external returns (bytes32 actualSolver);

/// @notice For batch filling entire orders.
function fillOrderOutputs(
    uint32 fillDeadline,
    bytes32 orderId,
    MandateOutput[] calldata outputs,
    bytes32 proposedSolver
) external;
```

## Validating Fills

After filling intents, the proof of fill has to be sent to the input chain. The oracle system used for the order is specified through `localOracle` and `output.oracle`. These should match. However, validating filled outputs is highly oracle specific. For more, [View Oracle System Architecture ->](/architecture/oracle/#implemented-validation-interfaces) ->

## Settling Orders

Lastly, intents have to be settled before their expiry. This is achieved by calling `finalise[withSignature]` on the designated InputSettler. The caller has to be the designated solver set on fill.

```solidity
function finalise(
    StandardOrder calldata order,
    bytes calldata signatures,
    uint32[] calldata timestamps,
    bytes32[] memory solvers,
    bytes32 destination,
    bytes calldata call
) external;
```
