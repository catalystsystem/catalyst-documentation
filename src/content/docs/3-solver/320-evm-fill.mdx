description: "To fill LI.FI intent orders, you need to support Output Settlement interfaces. Each Output Settlement interface is different, but most support the generic OutputDescription types and allow filling orders through a shared context."

To be able to finalise an intent, all outputs have to be delivered. This is done by submitting the intent outputs to the Output Settler as described by `output.settler`.

Currently, only one Output Settler is supported exposing 2 [fill interfaces](https://github.com/openintentsframework/oif-contracts/blob/d238f87d01552986b66d392d0f2ea77bd6e25f2f/src/output/BaseOutputSettler.sol#L101-L151):

```solidity
function fill(
    uint32 fillDeadline,
    bytes32 orderId,
    MandateOutput calldata output,
    bytes32 proposedSolver
) external virtual returns (bytes32 actualSolver);

function fillOrderOutputs(
    uint32 fillDeadline,
    bytes32 orderId,
    MandateOutput[] calldata outputs,
    bytes32 proposedSolver
) external;
```

Note that `fill` does not revert if an output has already been filled. It instead returns the address of the solver that has been recorded as the filler. You will not be debited any assets. If you need the fill to revert, use `fillOrderOutputs`.
