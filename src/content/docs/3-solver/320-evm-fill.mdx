To be able to finalise an intent, all outputs have to be delivered. This is done by submitting the intent outputs to the Output Settler as described by `output.settler`.

Currently, only one Output Settler is supported exposing 2 [fill interfaces](https://github.com/openintentsframework/oif-contracts/blob/d238f87d01552986b66d392d0f2ea77bd6e25f2f/src/output/BaseOutputSettler.sol#L101-L151):

```solidity
function fill(
    uint32 fillDeadline,
    bytes32 orderId,
    MandateOutput calldata output,
    bytes32 proposedSolver
) external virtual returns (bytes32 actualSolver);

function fillOrderOutputs(
    uint32 fillDeadline,
    bytes32 orderId,
    MandateOutput[] calldata outputs,
    bytes32 proposedSolver
) external;
```

Note that `fill` does not revert if an output has already been filled. It instead returns an identifier linked to the existing fill, without debiting any further assets. If it is desired for the `fill` call to revert, refer to `fillOrderOutputs`.
