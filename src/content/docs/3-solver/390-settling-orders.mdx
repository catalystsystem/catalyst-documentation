To settle LI.FI intent orders, up to 2 transactions may be required:
1. Submission of message validation
2. Finalizing the order on the resource lock.


## Oracle Validation

For instructions on how to relay proof for oracle systems, please refer to their section in [validation](/architecture/oracle).

## Finalizing Orders

Once the  `OutputProven` event has been observed, the output has been validated and `finalise` can be called.
```
event OutputProven(uint256 chainid, bytes32 remoteIdentifier, bytes32 application, bytes32 payloadHash);
```

For the CompactSettler (and compliant settlers), you need to submit the `StandardOrder`, the attached signatures as `bytes.concat(sponsor, allocator)`, the timestamps of the fills (which can be read from the `OutputFilled` event), and the solver's identifier or address. If there are multiple outputs, always index lists by their position in the order. Then, finalize can be called:

```solidity
function finalise(
    StandardOrder calldata order,
    bytes calldata signatures,
    uint32[] calldata timestamps,
    bytes32[] memory solvers,
    bytes32 destination,
    bytes calldata call
) external;
```

:::note
If an order contains multiple outputs and two solvers filled different outputs, then the solver of the 0th (first) output is the canonical solver.
