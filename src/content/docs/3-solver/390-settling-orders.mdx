To settle LI.FI intent orders, up to 2 transactions may be required:
1. Submission of message validation
2. Finalizing the order on the resource lock.


## Oracle Validation

For instructions on how to relay proof for oracle systems, please refer to their section in [validation](/architecture/oracle).

## Finalizing Orders

Once the  `OutputProven` event has been observed, the output has been validated and `finalise` can be called.
```
event OutputProven(uint256 chainid, bytes32 remoteIdentifier, bytes32 application, bytes32 payloadHash);
```

Depending on the settler used, you either have to call a finalise function with a different abi. `InputSettlerCompact` uses a signature required finalise function where `InputSettlerEscrow` does not.

For the `InputSettlerCompact` submit the `StandardOrder`, the attached signatures as `bytes.concat(sponsor, allocator)`, the timestamps of the fills (which can be read from the `OutputFilled` event), and the solver's identifier. If there are multiple outputs, always index lists by their position in the order. Then, finalize can be called. The flow is the same for `InputSettlerEscrow` except not signatures are provided.

```solidity
// Compact Input Settler
function finalise(
    StandardOrder calldata order,
    bytes calldata signatures,
    uint32[] calldata timestamps,
    bytes32[] memory solvers,
    bytes32 destination,
    bytes calldata call
) external;
// Escrow Input Settler
function finalise(
    StandardOrder calldata order,
    uint32[] calldata timestamps,
    bytes32[] memory solvers,
    bytes32 destination,
    bytes calldata call
) external;
```
```

:::note
If an order contains multiple outputs and two solvers filled different outputs, then the solver of the 0'th (first) output is the canonical solver.
