## Arbiter
An entity, contract, or mechanism capable of determining when the desired action of a resource lock has been fulfilled. It may also act as an allocator.

## Allocator
An entity that validates that a lock does not exceed a userâ€™s current balance. It may also act as an arbiter. When depositing into a lock, an allocator is chosen.

## Emissary
For smart wallets unable to provide stable signatures, an emissary can be used to produce stable signatures. The emissary is usually a trusted entity, meaning that once a signtaure is issued it cannot be redacted. The terminology is specific to The Compact.

## Fill First
A swap flow where the tokens are delivered to the user _before_ the input tokens are collected by a protocol. These flows use specialised wallet techniques like [resource locks](/glossary#resource-lock) to remain safe.

## Output Settler
A contract that records fill statements allowing oracles to get original proof that outputs have been sent to users.

## GMP
Generalized Message Passing. Describes a method to send messages between two chains. Examples include Wormhole, LayerZero, Hyperlane, and more.

## Lock
An allowance issued by a user to an arbiter. Before locks are valid, they must be signed by the user and co-signed by the allocator.

## Input
The starting point. Input assets refer to the assets paid into the intent system. The input chain refers to the chain(s) of the input assets.

## Integrator
See [Intent Issuer](#intent-issuer).

## Intent
An issuance of a desired action. Intents are often used to describe swaps but can also describe desired cross-chain interactions. Unlike swaps, intents should generally be composable. Intents are usually self-contained, meaning they describe both the desired end state and the payment to achieve that state; the output and input, respectively.

## Intent Issuer
Someone who issues intents for a cross-chain intent system. The intent issuers specifies how the intent is configured. It is then up to [solvers](#solver) to determine whether or not they will fill the intent.

## Optimistic
A validation method that assumes statements are true unless disputed.

## Oracle
A contract that can attest to the trueness of a statement. In an intent system, oracles act as validation layers attesting to whether or not the user's desires assets have been delivered. Oracles may use a variety of different mechanisms to attest: Optimistic, messaging bridge, light clients, etc. 

## Order Server
A server that sits between intent issuers and solvers aiding with broadcasting and distribution of intents.

## Output
The endpoint. Output assets refer to the desired tokens to be paid to the user (or used within a larger action). The output chain refers to the chain(s) of the output assets.

## Resource Lock
A clever 3/3 (or 2/2) multisignature scheme that provides unique balance abstractions. You can find a primer in our [knowledge hub](/knowledge/resource-locks).

## Input Settler
A contract in a cross-chain intent system that delivers assets. In a resource lock supporting cross-chain intent system, the input/origin settler is often an arbiter.

## Solver
A specialised third party who fulfills cross-chain intents using a variety of liquidity sources. They participate in the intent system with the goal of earning margins from the difference between the cost of achieving the end state and the inputs. 

## Sponsor
The owner of the tokens to be used for locks in a resource lock.

## Validator Layer
An entity capable of validating whether certain information has occurred. Examples include GMP, optimistic proof, or bridges.
